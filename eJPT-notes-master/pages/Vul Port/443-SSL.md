5 STAGES OF HACKING

### 1 Reconnaissance (Info gathering)
Recon has two parts 
1. Passive
2. Active (Scanning and Enumeration)

In this stage we also have to do the following
	1. Target Validation
		WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon
	2. Finding subdomains
		Google fu, dig, nmap, sublist3r, bluto, crt.sh
	3. Fingureprinting
		nmap, wappalyzer, whatweb, builtwhith, netcat
	4. Data breaches
		Havelbeenpwned, breach-parse, weleakinfo
		
		Note: If you find a database machine with authentication, try the default creds from the internet.







### 2 Scanning and Enumeration
1. Nmap
2. Source code analysis
3. Nikto
4. SMB

### 3 Gaining Access (Exploitation)

### 4 Maintaining Access

### 5 Covering tracks


### Screenshot taking tool for windows
Greenshot

### Note taking tool 
Keep note

For each host make sure you are creating a Keep note file.
Within the file
Create two sections
1. Scanning
	port number -- ip
	related vulnerabilites

	Nikto Scan results

2. Vulnerabilities
Port number - Potentially vulnerable to XXXX (url)
