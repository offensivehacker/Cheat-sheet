# Penetration Testing 

Penetration testers must test for any and all vulnerabilites, not just the ones that grant them root access to a system.

Considering the penetration test as a process, rather than an unstructured block of tasks, this ensures that every potential vulnerability or security weakness gets tested, with the lowest possible overhead.

| Method                    | Description                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Engagement                | Quotation, proposal submittal, scope of engagement, incident handling, legal work.                            |
| Information Gathering     | The process of collecting information before deploying any real attacks                                       |
| Footprinting and Scanning | Deepening your knowledge of the in-scope servers and services. Port scanning, detecting services...           |
| Vulnerability Assesment   | The process which defines, locates, and classifies the security leaks in a computer, network, or application. | 
| Exploitation              | Enabling pen testers to compromise a system and expose to it further attacks.                                 | 
| Reporting                 | Documenting all the steps that led to a successful attack during the test.                                    |

A successful exploit of a machine helps to investigate the target network further, to discover new targets and to repeat the process from the information gathering phase.

A penetration test is a <b>cyclic process.</b>

The process ends when there are no more systems and services in-scope to exploit.

Remember, a penetration test is used to find any and all vulnerabilities.

### Reporting

The report must address:

- Techniques used
- Vulnerabilities found
- Exploits used
- Impact and risk analysis for each vulnerability
- Remediation tips

### Widening the attack surface
Using your time at <b>"widening the attack surface"</b> is much more valuable than shooting darts at an unknown target. You do not know where to shoot, and you do not know which technique is the best to use.
